You must write a program that calculates uptime for stations in a charging network. It will take in a formatted input file that indicates individual charger uptime status for a given time period and write output to standard-output (`stdout`).

**Station Uptime** is defined as the percentage of time that any charger at a station was available, out of the entire time period that any charger _at that station_ was reporting in.
